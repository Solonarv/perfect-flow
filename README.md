## How to install

This program is not currently in any sort of finished state. As such, there are no binary releases available.

You can build it from source by running:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Solonarv/perfect-flow.git
cd perfect-flow
cabal build
```

Binary releases for old versions are still available by following the below instructions:

Download the [itch.io app](https://itch.io/app), then visit [solonarv.itch.io/perfect-flow](https://solonarv.itch.io/perfect-flow) and download the game.
You can then launch the game from the itch.io app.

If you don't want to use the itch.io app, you can also download the appropriate ZIP for your platform from [solonarv.itch.io/perfect-flow](https://solonarv.itch.io/perfect-flow),
extract it in a folder of your choosing, and launch the `perfect-flow` executable.
